The equilibration is followed by a 5 ns production in the NVT ensemble. The temperature is controlled using the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.5 ps. In all smulations, the temperature is kept at 298.15K. Bonds are constrained using LINCS. Periodic boundary conditions (PBC) are applied. Both Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions are truncated at a distance of 10 Å, and long range electrostatic interactions are treated using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) summation method. The Newton's equation of motion is integrated using the Verlet scheme with a time step of 2 fs. Snapshots are saved every 500 steps (1 ps). This results in a total of 5000 snapshots per compound.\n",

    "The ligand is centered in the box using gmx trjcov. Afterwards, the energy terms (LJ and electrostatic) are re-calculated using Reaction field (RF) instead of PME, which was employed for production. While PME is compatible with the force-field parametrization scheme of AMBER, it does not allow for a direct energy decomposition into solute-solute and solute-solvent terms, which is required for the construction of the MDFPs. Therefore, the energy terms are recomputed with the RF expression based on the trajectory coordinates using the “-rerun” option of the GROMACS mdrun tool (see also the [documentation of Gromacs](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1/user-guide/mdrun-features.html)). The RF dielectric permittivity is set to 78.5. For each trajectory snapshots, the energy values are stored in a file named \"nvt3_rf_basename.edr\". The gmx energy tool of Gromacs allows to extract the energy components from the edr energy file. The output \"nvt3_rf_basename.xvg\" file is required to construct the MDFPs. \n",
